1) An int variable has no set size; it can be 16, 32, or 64 bits. When the keyword “const” is added in front of the variable, it cannot be changed once declared. 
2) A function declaration and a function definition are similar but not the same. A function declaration is the source code for defining a variable. The function definition however is giving that defined variable a value and decides what happens with that function is called
3) An unsigned integer is one that will always be of positive value. This is useful because not only will a value never be negative but you can also use this to create bigger numbers with less memory by using the sign bit as an extra bit of memory. 
4) The following C++ code does not have the initial variable ‘sum’ declared. It must be declared, even if 0. Changing line 1 to be “int sum=0;” would fix the problem
5) The following code has a problem in line 2. One equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable. Two equal signs is used to check the variable if it matches a value and then moves on to complete what is inside the if statement. “if(n==0)” would fix this. 
6) In order to find how many bytes are used to store datatypes use the operator ‘sizeof()’. Place a variable type like int or short within the parenthesis to determine the size of that particular variable.
